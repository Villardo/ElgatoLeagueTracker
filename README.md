# lol-cds

1. Setup nginx proxy using config file in `proxy` (more instructions inside that folder)
2. Run `type_clipboard.ahk` to type out timed summoners in chat using `CTRL+SHIFT+V`
3. Install the lol-cds plugin by either copying the `lol-cds.sdPlugin` folder to `%APPDATA%\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins` or by double clicking on `lol-cds.streamDeckPlugin`

This is quite a low-effort plugin and could definitely use some love. If you have any fixes or ideas, feel free to create a pull request!
